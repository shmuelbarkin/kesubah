# The Kesubah

Welcome to The Kesubah repo!

This repo is for the [The Kesubah website](https://thekesubah.com).

The objective of The Kesubah website is to present a clear translation and basic explanation of the Kesubah. A Kesubah is a contract that every Jewish man signs when he gets married. In it, he obligates himself to his wife to provide her with her needs and what he will provide his wife in the event of divorce or death. If you plan on signing this contract, or already did, but you were wondering what the contract actually contains, wonder no more! Read on.
All comments, corrections, and suggestions are welcome. Feel free to contact me.
